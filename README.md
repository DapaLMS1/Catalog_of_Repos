Repository Social Preview Card Generator

This repository uses a custom GitHub Action workflow to automatically generate unique, informative social media preview cards for the repository.

When someone shares a link to this repository on platforms like Twitter, Slack, or Discord, a custom image showing key repository details will be displayed instead of the default, generic GitHub card.

üöÄ How It Works

The entire process runs automatically inside the GitHub Actions CI/CD environment. The workflow is triggered on every push to the main branch, or manually via workflow_dispatch.

The core mechanism is defined in the .github/workflows/generate_preview.yml file and powered by a Node.js script that uses a headless browser.

Workflow Steps (Defined in generate_preview.yml):

Environment Setup: Installs Node.js v20 and the necessary Chromium system dependencies required to run the headless browser (Puppeteer).

Dependency Install: Runs npm ci to install project dependencies (puppeteer, simple-git) based on the locked versions in package-lock.json.

Image Generation: Executes the generate_preview_script.js Node.js file.

This script uses simple-git to analyze the repository data.

It uses Puppeteer to launch a headless browser, render a custom HTML/CSS template containing the repository data, and take a high-resolution screenshot.

Commit: The stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action checks for the newly created image file (typically in a previews/ directory). If changes are detected, it automatically commits and pushes the image back to the repository under the name github-actions[bot].

üìÇ Required Files

This automation requires three core configuration and code files in the repository root:

File

Purpose

.github/workflows/generate_preview.yml

The GitHub Action definition. This file sets the triggers, permissions, and the sequence of steps for the automation.

package.json

Lists the Node.js dependencies (puppeteer, simple-git) needed for the script.

package-lock.json

Locks the exact version of every dependency to ensure the CI environment is always reproducible and stable.

generate_preview_script.js

The main logic file. This JavaScript script is responsible for analyzing the repo data and generating the image using Puppeteer.

üõ†Ô∏è Usage and Maintenance

Triggering: The workflow runs automatically on every push to main or can be run manually via the Actions tab on GitHub (using the "Run workflow" button).

Preventing Loops: The workflow includes a critical check (if: github.actor != 'github-actions[bot]') to ensure it does not re-trigger itself when it commits the newly generated image.

Customization: To change the appearance or content of the social card, modify the HTML/CSS template within the generate_preview_script.js file.
